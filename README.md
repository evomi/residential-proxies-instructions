Welcome to Evomi's Residential Proxies repository! This project demonstrates how to use our high-quality residential proxies in various programming languages.

## What are Residential Proxies?


Residential proxies are IP addresses provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to homeowners. When you use our residential proxies, your requests appear to come from real residential locations, providing better anonymity and reducing the chance of being blocked by websites.

## Getting Started

Before running any of the example scripts, you need to set up your credentials:

```bash
export proxy_username=your_username
export proxy_password=your_password
```

Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with the credentials provided by Evomi.

## Usage Examples

We provide example scripts in 6 different programming languages to help you get started quickly:

### cURL
```bash
curl -x rp.evomi.com:1000 -U "${proxy_username}:${proxy_password}" https://ip.evomi.com/s
```

### Python
```bash
python python_example.py
```

### Node.js
```bash
node nodejs_example.js
```

### PHP
```bash
php php_example.php
```

### Go
```bash
go run go_example.go
```

### Java
```bash
javac JavaExample.java
java JavaExample
```

### C#
```bash
dotnet run
```
